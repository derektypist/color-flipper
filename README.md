# Color Flipper

The purpose of this project is to provide a color flipper, using plain JavaScript without frameworks.

## UX

As a user, when I hover on to a button, I expect the background to be white and the color to be black.

As a user, when I hover on to the links, I get a different color.

As a user, when I am on index.html, I expect the the name of the background color, its rgba or its hex value (e.g. #f15025).

As a user, when I am on hex.html, I expect the hex value of the background color (e.g. #D5EEA4).

As a user, when I click on the button, I expect a random background color.

Information Architecture
